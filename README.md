# CodingChallenge

1. Basic Architecture requirements
React-Native
Expo: Used expo (managed) version 47+ to make it easy for you and myself - so app can run inside Expo Go.
UI: Build custom components, but used @expo/vector-icons package, because I couldn't use some of the icons provided in Figma design.
State Management: react-redux and reduxjs/toolkit packages are used.
TypeScript: It is written in Typescript
